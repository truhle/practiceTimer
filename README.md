# practiceTimer

Single-page practice timer with choice of two clock faces-- an enso that draws itself and a digital 
countdown.  Pure Javascript, HTML/XML and CSS.

When animating the enso timer face, it automatically adjusts framerate to reduce power consumption.  

Adjusts to mobile Android and iPhone screens, though it does not work in the native Android browser. 
Use mobile Chrome, Firefox or Opera (though not Opera mini)..

It cannot keep a screen on if it screen is set to dim after a certain time.  You can adjust your 
screen dimmer settings, or you can use a tool, such as:
